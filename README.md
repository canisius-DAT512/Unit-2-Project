To allow students to demonstrate the following competencies:
- Critical thinking skills deployed to the domain of e-commerce
- Ability to design analytical workflow cloud databases and hosted jupyter notebook
- Proficiency in SQL and Python and articulating the decision of where to aggregate data
- Capability to create meaningful and relevant observations and recommendations from a dataset

### Prompt

2. Functional and documented data importation. 
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In the comments, describe any assumptions made.
4. Show conclusions with images and explainers in markdown cells.
### Rubric
